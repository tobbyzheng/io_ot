===========

Sebastion Magwick's IMU and AHRS sensor fusion algorithms in JavaScript.


This is MadgwickAHRS.c and MahonyAHRS.c taken from X-IO Technologies [Open source IMU and AHRS algorithms](http://www.x-io.co.uk/open-source-imu-and-ahrs-algorithms/) and hand translated to JavaScript.

Wrapped up in a THREE.js visualization of IMU motion.

Can be viewed in a browser from index.html or installed as a Chrome App or Chrome browser extension.

Real accelerometer, gyro and magnetometer data can be fed in via a serial link when used as a Chrome app or extension.
